# WhoRang Addon Config and Permissions - Comprehensive Fix Summary

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of all issues identified and resolved in the WhoRang Home Assistant addon, specifically focusing on configuration propagation and permissions problems. Through systematic analysis and targeted fixes, we have successfully resolved all critical issues preventing proper addon functionality in Home Assistant OS environments.

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Home Assistant Addon Configuration Propagation

**Problem**: Configuration changes made in Home Assistant addon options (database path, uploads path, etc.) were not being picked up by the Node.js backend.

**Root Cause**: Environment variables set in `run.sh` were not reliably inherited by the Node.js backend when `docker-entrypoint.sh` was invoked, breaking the configuration chain from Home Assistant UI to the application.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Modified `docker-entrypoint.sh` to respect `WHORANG_ADDON_MODE` environment variable if already set
- Enhanced `run.sh` to properly export all configuration values as environment variables before calling `docker-entrypoint.sh`
- Added comprehensive logging in `run.sh` to show all configuration values being set for easier debugging
- Updated the Node.js backend's `configReader.js` to correctly prioritize environment variables over Home Assistant options
- Verified configuration precedence: Environment Variables (highest) → Home Assistant Options → Defaults (lowest)

### 2. Native Node.js Module Permission Errors

**Problem**: Native Node.js modules (`sharp`, `canvas`, `better-sqlite3`) failed to load due to permission errors in `/app/node_modules`.

**Root Cause**: `/app/node_modules` and native `.node` files did not have correct ownership or permissions for the running user in Home Assistant OS restrictive environment.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Updated `Dockerfile` to ensure proper ownership and permissions on `/app` and `/app/node_modules` at build time
- Modified `docker-entrypoint.sh` to set correct permissions on `/app/node_modules` at container startup
- Added specific handling for native `.node` files to ensure they have executable permissions
- Verified all native modules load successfully in both local Docker tests and Home Assistant OS environment

### 3. Nginx Permission and Logging Issues

**Problem**: Nginx was trying to access log files and perform chown operations on restricted directories, causing permission errors in Home Assistant OS.

**Root Cause**: Default nginx behavior was attempting to create log files and access restricted directories that are not allowed in Home Assistant OS security model.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Updated nginx configuration to redirect all logs to stdout/stderr, complying with Home Assistant addon requirements
- Modified `docker-entrypoint.sh` to explicitly start nginx with `master_process off` to prevent setgid errors
- Ensured nginx temp/cache/run directories have correct ownership (`nobody` user) to match running user
- Made nginx directories world-writable (chmod 777) to prevent chown errors in Home Assistant OS
- Added cleanup of default nginx configurations that might cause file-based logging
- Verified nginx starts without permission errors and logs correctly to stdout/stderr

### 4. Docker Image Publishing and Multi-arch Support

**Problem**: Home Assistant could not pull the new image tag (404 error), and architecture-specific images were not accessible.

**Root Cause**: GitHub Actions workflow was not properly tagging and publishing images for all architectures, and package visibility was not set correctly for Home Assistant's multi-arch requirements.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to properly build and publish both multi-arch manifest and architecture-specific images
- Ensured all GHCR packages are set to public visibility for Home Assistant addon discovery
- Corrected Home Assistant base image mapping for each architecture (arm64 → aarch64, arm/v7 → armv7)
- Verified successful image pull and addon installation in Home Assistant across all supported architectures

## Key Code Changes

### File: `whorang/run.sh`
- Enhanced bashio detection and configuration loading with proper error handling
- Added comprehensive logging of all configuration values for debugging
- Properly export all configuration values as environment variables before invoking docker-entrypoint.sh
- Improved error handling and validation of configuration values

### File: `whorang/docker-entrypoint.sh`
- Respect `WHORANG_ADDON_MODE` if already set by run.sh
- Ensure environment variables from `run.sh` are inherited by Node.js backend
- Set correct permissions on `/app/node_modules` for native module loading at runtime
- Explicitly start nginx with proper flags to prevent permission errors
- Ensure nginx directories have correct ownership and permissions
- Added validation checks for directory permissions before starting services

### File: `whorang/Dockerfile`
- Set proper ownership and permissions on `/app` at build time
- Ensure native `.node` files have correct permissions for module loading
- Create necessary directories with appropriate permissions
- Added multi-stage build for better security and smaller image size
- Updated base images to match Home Assistant OS requirements

### File: `.github/workflows/build.yml`
- Updated to properly build and publish multi-arch images for all supported architectures
- Ensured package visibility is set to public for Home Assistant addon discovery
- Corrected base image mapping for all architectures
- Added proper tagging strategy for version releases
- Implemented build validation and testing steps

## Verification and Testing

All fixes have been thoroughly verified through multiple testing approaches:

### 1. Enhanced Docker Testing
- Created comprehensive Docker test with mocked bashio functionality
- Verified correct Home Assistant add-on mode detection
- Confirmed configuration values are properly propagated from Home Assistant options to the Node.js backend
- Verified native Node.js modules load without permission errors
- Confirmed nginx starts without permission errors and logs correctly to stdout/stderr
- Validated both nginx and Node.js backend start and run correctly

### 2. Configuration Precedence Testing
- Created Node.js test to verify configuration precedence rules
- Confirmed environment variables correctly override Home Assistant options (highest priority)
- Verified Home Assistant options are properly loaded when environment variables are not set
- Validated default values are used when neither environment variables nor HA options are provided

### 3. Docker Image Publishing Verification
- Verified successful build and publication of multi-arch images
- Confirmed all GHCR packages are publicly accessible
- Tested image pull and addon installation in Home Assistant across all supported architectures
- Validated that both multi-arch manifest and architecture-specific images are accessible

## Results Achieved

✅ **Configuration Propagation**: Home Assistant addon configuration changes now correctly propagate to the backend
✅ **Native Module Loading**: All native Node.js modules load without permission errors
✅ **Nginx Compliance**: Nginx runs without permission errors and complies with Home Assistant logging requirements
✅ **Multi-arch Support**: Docker images are properly built and published for all supported architectures
✅ **Home Assistant Compatibility**: Addon is fully compatible with Home Assistant OS security model
✅ **Error Resolution**: All permission errors and configuration issues have been resolved

## Deployment Readiness

The WhoRang addon is now fully ready for deployment in Home Assistant environments. All critical issues have been resolved, and comprehensive testing has validated the fixes. The addon will:

1. Correctly read configuration from Home Assistant UI
2. Properly propagate configuration changes to the Node.js backend
3. Load all native modules without permission errors
4. Run nginx without permission errors in Home Assistant OS
5. Be available for installation across all supported architectures

## Next Steps

The addon is ready for production use in Home Assistant environments. No further development work is required. Users can now:

1. Install the addon directly from Home Assistant addon store
2. Configure database and upload paths through the Home Assistant UI
3. Expect all configuration changes to be properly applied
4. Use all addon features without encountering permission errors

This comprehensive fix ensures the WhoRang addon provides a seamless experience for Home Assistant users while maintaining full compatibility with Home Assistant OS security requirements.
