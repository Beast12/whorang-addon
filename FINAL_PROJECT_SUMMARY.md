   - GHCR packages publicly accessible for Home Assistant addon discovery
   - Verified working installation across all platforms

### Verification Results

All fixes have been thoroughly verified through comprehensive testing:

✅ Enhanced Docker test with mocked bashio functionality
✅ Configuration precedence validation
✅ Native module loading verification
✅ Nginx permission and logging compliance
✅ Multi-arch image accessibility verification
✅ Final comprehensive verification script
✅ Final enhanced Docker test

### Key Implementation Files

1. `whorang/run.sh` - Enhanced configuration loading and logging
2. `whorang/docker-entrypoint.sh` - Fixed environment variable inheritance and permissions
