# Changelog

All notable changes to the WhoRang AI Doorbell Add-on will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.23] - 2025-08-01

### Fixed
- **Database Initialization**: Resolved a critical startup error by refactoring the database initialization logic. All schema creation is now centralized in `databaseManager.js`, removing dependencies on external `.sql` files and ensuring the database is always correctly configured on startup.
- **API Stability**: Fixed a `500 Internal Server Error` on the `/api/stats` endpoint by correctly registering the stats router in `server.js` using the dependency injection pattern.

### Changed
- **Version**: Bumped to v2.0.23 to reflect the latest backend fixes.

## [2.0.28] - 2025-08-01

### Fixed
- **Critical Startup Crash**: Fixed a `TypeError` that caused the application to crash immediately on startup. The webhook router was being initialized before its `multer` dependency, leading to a fatal error. The module has been correctly refactored to ensure all middleware is initialized before being used.

## [2.0.27] - 2025-08-01

### Fixed
- **Runtime Crash**: Resolved a critical `EACCES: permission denied` error at startup. The `multer` middleware was using a hardcoded, inaccessible path (`/app/uploads`). The code has been refactored to correctly use the user-configured uploads path from the central `directoryManager`, ensuring file uploads are saved to the proper `/data/uploads` directory.

## [2.0.26] - 2025-08-01

### Fixed
- **Container Startup**: Resolved critical `unknown user` errors by restoring user creation in the `Dockerfile` and correcting the Node.js service script to use the proper `whorun` user. This ensures all `s6-overlay` scripts can execute correctly.

## [2.0.25] - 2025-08-01

### Fixed
- **Container Startup**: Resolved a critical "Permission denied" error by making all `s6-overlay` initialization and service scripts executable. This allows the container to start correctly.

## [2.0.24] - 2025-08-01

### Changed
- **Architecture**: Refactored the entire addon to use the `s6-overlay` process management system, aligning with official Home Assistant best practices. This replaces the custom entrypoint script with proper service and initialization scripts for improved stability and maintainability.

### Fixed
- **Runtime Stability**: Resolved critical container startup failures by adopting the standard `s6-overlay` pattern, which correctly handles process supervision and user permissions.

## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.22] - 2025-08-01

### Added
- **Dependency Injection**: Implemented full dependency injection across the backend, refactoring services and controllers into factory functions or classes that accept injected dependencies. This improves modularity, testability, and maintainability.

### Fixed
- **Startup Stability**: Resolved all `EACCES` permission warnings during local development by centralizing path validation and gracefully handling fallback paths.
- **Test Suite Failures**: Debugged and fixed a series of cascading errors in the `local_test.sh` script, including:
  - A `404 Not Found` error caused by a broken nginx run script.
  - A `Connection reset by peer` error caused by a missing nginx configuration file in the Docker image.
  - A `500 Internal Server Error` caused by incorrect Express.js routing for the `/api/health` endpoint.
- **CI Pipeline**: Fixed a `500 Internal Server Error` on the `/api/stats` endpoint by refactoring the stats route to use dependency injection and registering it correctly in the Express application.
- **Configuration Handling**: Ensured asynchronous initialization is properly handled for all components, resolving startup errors related to module loading and configuration initialization.

### Changed
- **Version**: Bumped to v2.0.22 to reflect the significant backend refactoring and bug fixes.

## [2.0.18] - 2025-07-29

### Fixed
- **CI Test Compatibility**: Fixed bashio sourcing issues in run.sh for CI test environments where bashio is not available or has syntax errors
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling and fallback logic for bashio library loading

### Changed
- **Version**: Bumped to v2.0.18 to reflect CI test compatibility fixes

## [2.0.17] - 2025-07-29

### Fixed
- **Docker Build**: Removed invalid 'apk add --no-cache bashio' command that was causing build failures
- **Base Image Compatibility**: Ensured proper compatibility with Home Assistant base images that already include bashio

### Changed
- **Version**: Bumped to v2.0.17 to reflect Docker build fix

## [2.0.16] - 2025-07-29

### Fixed
- **Configuration Propagation**: Resolved issues with Home Assistant addon configuration not being properly passed to the Node.js backend
